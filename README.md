# PBJ Live Javascript SDK
![Live](banner.png)

Stream your [pbj.live](https://pbj.live) content from your web App.

# ðŸ“¦ Installation

## 1. Import the web-sdk package:

#### Using CDN

```html
<script src="https://js.pbj.live/sdk.js"></script>
```

#### Using NPM

`npm install @pbj/live.js`
or
`yarn add @pbj/live.js`

```js
import Live from '@pbj/live.js';
```


This script will expose a global `Live` class. Initiate the class with your organization api key:

## 2. Initialize the LivePlayerSDK with your api key:
```
const live = new Live("<Your API KEY>")
```

# ðŸš€  Usage

When the `Live` class is initiated you will be able to do several things:

- Render a PBJ Live stream to a HTML element
- Retrieve information from our APIs

## Elements

### Embed element
*Currently our recommended way to integrate with PBJ Live.*

#### html

In your html, create a `div` tag with your preferred naming, we use `live-element` in these examples. 

So in your html, add:
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <!--- Add Live element here ---!>
    <div id="live-element"></div>
    
    <script src="https://js.pbj.live/v1/sdk.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var live = new Live("<Your API Key>");
      
      // Create instance of the iframe embed
      var embedPlayer = live.elements.embed()
       
      // Mount the player to the div#live-element in our html
      const liveElement = document.querySelector('#live-element');
      embedPlayer.mount(liveElement, {
        // (Optional) Channel ID can be passed within an object, i.e. the second parameter for the mount method.
        channelId: '0c2e035f-fd07-4390-921f-1e1e865805f1',
        // More about channel ID in "Using different channels" section below.
      })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### using hooks

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import Live from '@pbj/live.js';

const LiveVideo = () => {
  const liveElementRef = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
      var live = new Live("<Your API Key>", {
        environment: 'demo'
      });

      // Create instance of the iframe embed
      var embedPlayer = live.elements.embed()
       
      // Mount the player to the div in our html
      embedPlayer.mount(liveElementRef.current, {
        // (Optional) Channel ID can be passed within an object, i.e. the second parameter for the mount method.
        channelId: '0c2e035f-fd07-4390-921f-1e1e865805f1',
        // More about channel ID in "Using different channels" section below.
      })
  }, [])

  return <div ref={liveElementRef}><div/>
}

```

In the background, this `embed()` method will create an iFrame that will injected into your html element, we also offer a lower level solution via the `live.elements.video()` method.

#### Using different channels
Selecting a specific channel to show in the LIVE video player requires the channel_id option to be added to the options while calling the `embedPlayer.mount`.

```js
embedPlayer.mount(liveElement, {
  channelId: '<Your channel ID>',
})
```
To get the channel ID go to the dashboard and select a stream from the dropdown `Select Streams`. Once, you've selected this channel, copy the ID in the URL address bar. (URL format: https://pbj.live/dashboard/broadcast/Your-Channel-ID
Example: <br/>
URL: `https://pbj.live/dashboard/broadcast/31d319ae-919b-4ac2-bd10-f9a390c9aa81`<br/>
Channel ID: `31d319ae-919b-4ac2-bd10-f9a390c9aa81`

    options: {
      hideLiveLogo: true,
      hideTitle: true,

      hideShoppingCart: true,
    },
  });

  // Do something after joining the event!
}
  
liveSockets.send(socketMessage, callback);

```
